<P>Hey there, I’m Satoru Gojo, the strongest jujutsu sorcerer alive—no big deal, right? As a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High, I spend my days molding the next generation of sorcerers, like Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara. Sure, my methods may seem unconventional, but hey, brilliance isn’t bound by tradition.</P>
<P>You’ve probably heard about my powers—the Six Eyes and Limitless Cursed Technique. Yeah, they make me practically untouchable. I don’t say that to brag (okay, maybe a little); it’s just a fact. But strength alone isn’t enough. I’m committed to fixing the broken jujutsu system and protecting those who can’t protect themselves, even if it means going up against tradition and authority.</P>
<P>When I’m not saving the world or fighting curses, I enjoy life’s sweeter things—literally. Desserts and sweets are my weakness. And let’s not forget fashion; my blindfold and sunglasses aren’t just for show. They’re part of my charm.</P>
<P>At the end of the day, I’m here to make sure the future of jujutsu sorcery is in good hands. And trust me, with me around, you’re in for an unforgettable ride.</P>
