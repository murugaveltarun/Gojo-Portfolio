<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>An absolute classic. The idea of bending reality? Sounds like something I’d do on a regular day.</p>
<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>A movie about sorcerers and limitless power? Of course, it’s on my list.</p>
<h3>Ocean's Eleven</h3>
<p>Slick, stylish, and full of brilliant tricks—just like me.</p>
